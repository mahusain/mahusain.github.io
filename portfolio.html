  <h3>Corrupted Vault of Bones, Glitch Art, 2019</h3>
  <p>I imported the picture into Audacity and then applied Distortion and Echo onto the data. After layering the effects on top of each other, this was the end result. The original picture was a screenshot from an episode of Adventure Time, a show that I used to watch when I was in High School.</p>

  <h3>Keep the World Wide Web Free, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
  <p>These pictures were made in protest to Article 13, a law in the EU that could threaten the freedom of internet users in Europe and possibly the rest of the world at large. I wanted to make the images as striking as possible, so I took images that were symbolically related to the message and made them monochrome. I also downloaded a custom font, Dead Man Walking, and typed out the messages in that font in order to make the slogan “Keep the World Wide Web Free!” more striking to the users.</p>

  <h3>University Noises, Digital Audio, 2019</h3>
  <p>I made this song from noises I recorded as I explored university. The tapping of a locker, the near silence of an empty hall, and the sound of a cash register was used for this. I wanted to create audio that represented the environment of university.</p>

    <h3>The Ambience of University, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
    <p>This video is more of an expansion of University Noises, only instead of just audio, I record specific objects or spots on university. I wanted to give off a rather lax environment as I showed off a project, a hallway, and a busy quad with a lot of people walking by.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://mahusain.github.io/netart/index.html">Art Haven</a>, Net Art, 2019</h3>
  <p>This is a website I created based on my earliest memories of the internet. Specifically, I designed a website based on the website DeviantART, a website I used to frequent as a young tween in middle school. I created some art based on the type of art I would see on dA and wrote little descriptions for each piece of art.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://mahusain.github.io/thesunandthemoon/">The Sun and the Moon</a>, Code Art, 2019</h3>
  <p>This is simply known as the Sun and the Moon. I opted to explore rotation around a certain object with this project. While it isn't that advanced, it does convey quite a bit about how everything seems to work. Even if it isn't completely accurate, I believe it turned out fairly well. In the end, I made a fairly interesting and minimalist interactive piece.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://mahusain.github.io/stressedstudent/">Stressed Student</a>, Combination Piece (Glitch Art and Net Art), 2019</h3>
  <p>This is an accumulation of a lot of the passion and emotions I had throughout this semester. I wanted to create something that many other students could understand and relate to. I wanted to send a message through this site and I've spent quite a bit to make sure it came out right. This website represented the mindset I had while making this and ultimately, I feel like a lot of other students could understand this.</p>
